## STEPS ON HOW I INSTALL SCSS
     ## STEPS ON HOW SASS WAS INSTALLED
 1. Navigated into my repository:PS C:\Users\innoc\alx-intermediate-frontend> and deprecated any node-sass if present:
  by running `npm uninstall node-sass`or install the nvm -version to manage all node versions.

 2. Check if Node.js + npm are installed using 
  node -v
  npm -v
  if not install using: https://nodejs.org
  Install Sass globally using: 
  npm install -g sass

 3. Check installed version: 
  npx sass --version.
  the Expected output:
  1.93.3 compiled with dart2js 3.5.2
